We expect the following nodes to be encountered: `0, 3, 8, 9, 10`. The topological order ensures that we _must_ encountered node `9` before we encounter node `10` -- even though if we started from node `0` and naively searched upward we might reach node `10` before `9`.\n",

    "Next, in order to get the \"equivalent\" DFS order, we have to start from the _roots_ and search down. This is because the DFS imposes a similar order via a LIFO (stack). Another way to put this: if you do a DFS over the whole graph, and save the order that nodes are visited in for the second visit, this is the same order that the topological order provides. In fact this is how `get_topo_order` is implemented, it numbers the nodes via DFS and then uses a heap to allow traversing a subset of those nodes."
